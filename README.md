# The Newsfeed Aggregator & Trending topics detector

This is a dropwizard rest app that stores, analyzes and provides a query api to retrieve<br/>
most recent  activities, listing, trendings topics, and all sort of aggregated behavioral information<br/>
happenning on this world.<br/>

This is just half of the code, the other half is the crawler written in javascript/jquery<br/> 
and the frontend app that displays all this information for consumption and configuration,<br/>
more on that later.

The idea is to build something akin to [Trending Topics](https://github.com/datawrangling/trendingtopics), but with a much simpler architecture.<br/>
The **trender** platform crawls, stores and makes use of search technologies and leverages the power<br/> of PostgreSQL to provide you accurate, diverse and descriptive information on realtime or at least near to realtime about what's happening on facebook.<br/>

## Motivation

    Prove that dropwizard rocks
    Master hibernate
    Build a simple but cool artificial-inteligence to detect trends
    Machine Learning
    Programming
    Having Fun
    Put my Solr and Lucene experience to the top
    Learn more about search/realtime technologies 
    Prove that hibernate can be great for large-scale apps (i may be wrong thou)
    How far can my thinkpad go ?
    A cool app for myself

## Getting Started

This is the backend only, trender is much bigger than this.<br/>
i need to organize all those js, html and php scripts under a <br/>
coesive, structured and organized architecture before i make them available<br/>
Also in this stage, the crawler requires a customized chrome-chromium extension, <br/>
so you can see i still got things a little bit "unsettled".

Enjoy
